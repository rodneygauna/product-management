# The Empowered Product Leadership Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of building successful products and creating empowered teams by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

1. Outcomes over outputs
   *Focus on delivering meaningful business and customer results, not just shipping features.*

2. Empowered product teams over managed delivery teams
   *Foster autonomy, ownership, and accountability within teams rather than simply assigning tasks.*

3. Vision and strategy over reactive roadmaps
   *Inspire teams with a clear vision and strategic alignment instead of dictating detailed plans.*

4. Continuous discovery over fixed requirements
   *Regularly validate ideas through experimentation, research, and customer feedback instead of relying solely on upfront assumptions.*

5. Collaboration over silos
   *Product managers, designers, and engineers work together as problem solvers rather than working in isolation.*

6. Leadership through context over control
   *Provide clarity on purpose, goals, and priorities rather than micromanaging decisions.*

7. Innovation over conformity
   *Encourage creative solutions to problems instead of settling for "the way we've always done it."*

8. Customer-centricity over internal priorities
   *Deeply understand and solve customer problems rather than focusing exclusively on business or stakeholder demands.*

## Supporting Principles

1. Trust in teams: Empowered teams are composed of people who are smart, motivated, and close to the problems. Leaders trust their judgment and decisions.
2. Strong product leadership: Effective leaders provide clear objectives, inspire teams with purpose, and coach them to success without telling them how to do their jobs.
3. Accountability for outcomes: Teams own the success of their products and are held accountable for achieving meaningful outcomesâ€”not just for shipping on time.
4. Data-informed decisions: Teams use data, evidence, and insights from customers to guide decisions, balancing qualitative and quantitative inputs.
5. Fast, iterative experimentation: Product discovery and delivery happen through small, rapid iterations to learn quickly, reduce risk, and innovate.
6. Celebrate learning and failure: Teams learn more from failed experiments than from inaction. Leaders create safe environments for learning, growth, and improvement.
7. Alignment without control: Leaders ensure that teams understand and align with business goals, empowering them to choose how best to achieve those outcomes.
8. Focus on empowered teams, not heroes: Success comes from teams working collaboratively, not from individuals acting alone or as saviors.

This manifesto is a call to product leaders and teams to embrace empowerment, enable innovation, and focus on solving real problems to deliver meaningful results. It represents a mindset shift from "shipping features" to building products customers love and businesses need.
