# Product Management: Product-Led Company

## Understanding Value

Most companies are stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. This is when the company is focused more on shipping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things provide.

Value, from a business perspective, is straightforward - money, data, captial, etc. is what drives the business. Every feature you build and any initiative you take as a s company should result in some outcome that is tied back to that business value.
Value can be difficult to measure well from a customer or user perspective. Products and servicers are not inherently valuable. It's what they do for the customer that has the value - solving a problem or fullfilling a desire or need. Doing this repeatedly and reliably is what guides a company to success.

When companies do not understand their customer's problems well, they cannot possibly define value for them. Instead of doing the work to learn this information about customers, they create a proxy that is easy to measure. "Value" becomes the quantity of features that are delivered. As a result, the number of feature shipped becomes the primary metric of success.

Yet, when you ask your customers if they received the "value" for what they pay for, their answers usually don't include the number for features that were released. Instead, they will speak to what problem was fixed or what need was fullfilled with a specific set of features. Customers don't care about what you squeezed into a release cycle, they care if their problems and needs are solved -- this is their "value".

## Value Exchange

Value Realized for Customers:

+ Problems Solved
+ Needs Acheived
+ Wants Fullfilled

Value Realized for Business:

+ Revenue
+ Growth
+ Add anything else here, but MONEY IS KING

Only by meeting the value for your customers will you meet the vlue for your business.

**Stop measuring output, start measuring outcomes!**

## Becoming Product-Led

Product-led companies optimize for their:

+ Business outcomes (Business Goals)
+ Align their product strategy to those goals
+ Prioritize the most effective project that help develop those produst into sustainable drivers of growth

## Defining Business Outcomes (Goals)

Most companies define yearly goals. Examples can be an increase in revenue, customer growth and retention, and increase in customer satisfaction.

Building a clear set of goals is needed in order to build a strategy to achieve them.

Make those clear and constent to everyone in the company. Every employee should know what the business is looking to achieve; from the simple to the complex.

Here are some examples of a company's goals:

+ Revenue:
  + Increase by 10%
+ Growth
  + 5 net-new customers every quarter
  + Reduce customer attrition by 30%
+ Satisfaction
  + NPS increase by 10%

## Building a Product Strategy

In most product organizations, there should be four levels in strategy deployment:

1. Vision
2. Strategic intent
3. Product initiative
4. Options

Vision - What do we want to be in 5-10 years? Value for customers, position in market, what our business looks like.
Strategic intent - What business challenges are standing in our way to reaching our vision?
Product initiative - What problems can we address to tackle the challenge from a product perpective?
Options - What are the different ways I can address those problems to reach my (and the company's goals)?

The goals here are to establish the basics for any company; increase revenue, protest revenue, reduce costs, and avoid costs.

### Toyota's Improvement Kata

Strategy is about how you take the organization from wher you currently are and reach the vision. Toyota created the Improvement Kata that helped it determine its strategies.

1. Understand the Direction or Challenge
2. Grasp the Current Condition
3. Establish the Next Target Condition
4. Experiment Toward the Target condition

### The Product Kata

Taking from Toyota's Improvement Kata, we can make a Product Kata

1. Understand the Direction (Company Vision and Strategic Intent)
2. Analyze the Current Stat (Current State of Initiative/Product)
3. Set the Next Goal (Product Initiative)
4. Choose Step of Product Process (Problem Exploration, Solution Exploration, Solution Optimization)

### Product Strategy

A crucial aspect of becoming product-led is developing a strong "Product Strategy."Product Strategy:

Product strategy is a high-level plan that outlines how a company's products will achieve its overarching business goals and objectives. It provides a framework for making decisions about what products to build, for whom, and how to differentiate them in the market. A well-defined product strategy ensures alignment between the product development efforts and the company's overall vision and mission.

#### Components of a Product Strategy

1. Vision: This is the long-term aspiration for what the product aims to become. It paints a picture of the impact the product will have on customers and the industry.
2. Mission: The mission statement outlines the purpose of the product, the target audience, and the value it provides. It sets the direction for the product's development and guides decision-making.
3. Goals and Objectives: These are measurable outcomes that the product team aims to achieve. They should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
4. Target Market and Customer Segments: Define the primary audience for your product. This includes understanding their needs, pain points, and preferences.
5. Value Proposition: Clearly articulate the unique value your product provides to customers. What problem does it solve? Why should customers choose your product over alternatives?
6. Competitive Analysis: Understand your competitors and how your product differentiates itself in the market. Identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
7. Roadmap: Outline the key features and initiatives that will be developed over time to achieve the product's goals. The roadmap should align with the goals and take into account market trends and customer feedback.
8. Resource Allocation: Allocate resources (budget, time, team members) to support the execution of the product strategy effectively.

Example:

Let's consider an example of a fictitious software company, "TechSolutions," that wants to become product-led by creating a new project management tool for remote teams:

Vision: To empower remote teams worldwide with a seamless and collaborative project management experience that enhances productivity and fosters innovation.

Mission: Our mission is to provide a user-friendly project management tool tailored for remote teams, enabling efficient communication, task tracking, and resource management. By doing so, we aim to enable businesses to thrive in the era of remote work.

Goals and Objectives:

Achieve 50,000 monthly active users within the first year of launch.
Attain a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 40 or higher by the end of the second quarter.
Increase user engagement by 20% through the introduction of real-time collaboration features in the next six months.
Target Market and Customer Segments: Distributed teams in small to medium-sized businesses across various industries, including tech, marketing, and creative services.

Value Proposition: Our project management tool streamlines remote team collaboration by offering real-time task updates, interactive timelines, and integrated communication channels, resulting in enhanced efficiency and team cohesion.

Competitive Analysis: Analyze competitors such as Asana, Trello, and Monday.com to identify gaps in features and opportunities for differentiation.

Roadmap:

Q1: Develop core task management features (to-do lists, progress tracking).
Q2: Introduce real-time chat integration for seamless communication.
Q3: Roll out timeline visualization for project planning.
Q4: Launch mobile app for on-the-go accessibility.
Resource Allocation: Allocate 60% of the development team's time, 30% of the design team's time, and a marketing budget of $500,000 for the first year.

This example demonstrates how a comprehensive product strategy aligns the company's vision, mission, goals, and resources to create a clear path for product development and growth.

Remember, an effective product strategy is not static; it should evolve based on feedback, market changes, and new opportunities. Regularly revisit and refine your product strategy to ensure it remains relevant and aligned with the company's goals.

## Product Initiative

In order to meet businesses' defined goals, the product's strategy should determine the following:

+ Problems
+ Outcomes

Let's take an example business goal of "Increase revenue growth from 5% year-over-year to 10% year-over-year."

Brainstorm the whys and whats:

+ What problems are the obsticle that's keeping us for meeting this goal today?
+ What are we hearing from the potential customers and sales team as why the customer didn't go with us?
+ What are we hearing from internal and external customers as to why they are leaving?
+ What potential problems can we solve?

From these questions, we'll need to talk to PEOPLE (customers, collueges, etc.).

We should come back with a few initatives. For example:

+ We believe that by creating a way for users to do X, we can increase acquisition, resulting in Y revenue increase over T.
+ We belive that by improving X feature, we can acquire more customers and retain existing users by Y, resulting in Z potential revuew increase per T.

These are the initiatives the team will persue that will provide "value" the business and customer.

In order to determine these initatives, the product team needs to understand PROBLEMS and OUTCOMES.

## Defining Problems

Defining "Problems" is a crucial step in the process of becoming a product-led company, as it involves identifying and understanding the challenges or pain points that your target customers are facing. A problem-centric approach ensures that your product development efforts are focused on providing meaningful solutions that resonate with your audience. Here's more information on defining problems:

1. Customer-Centric Perspective: The process of defining problems starts with putting yourself in the shoes of your customers. Understand their needs, frustrations, and goals to identify the issues they encounter in their daily lives or business operations.
2. Problem Validation: It's essential to validate that the problems you're identifying are real and impactful. Conduct thorough research, interviews, surveys, and data analysis to gather evidence of the problems' existence and significance.
3. Specificity: Define problems in specific terms. Vague or broad problem statements can lead to unclear solutions. For example, "Improving team collaboration" is less specific than "Streamlining communication among remote team members."
4. Root Causes: Dig deeper to uncover the underlying causes of the problems. This helps you avoid treating symptoms and instead address the core issues.
5. Prioritization: Not all problems are equally urgent or relevant. Prioritize problems based on factors such as customer impact, business alignment, and feasibility.
6. Quantifiable Impact: Ideally, problems should be quantifiable so that their impact can be measured over time. This is important for tracking the effectiveness of the solutions you implement.

Example:

Continuing with the example of "TechSolutions" creating a project management tool for remote teams:

Problem: Remote teams struggle with coordinating tasks and staying aligned on project progress due to scattered communication channels and lack of real-time updates.

Validation: Conducted interviews with remote team managers from different industries, and 75% of respondents expressed frustration with communication gaps causing project delays.

Root Causes: Lack of a centralized platform for real-time task updates, reliance on multiple communication tools, and time zone differences leading to delayed responses.

Specificity: The problem is not just about remote teams struggling with collaboration, but specifically about the challenges arising from scattered communication and a lack of real-time updates.

Prioritization: Given the increasing trend of remote work, addressing this problem aligns with the company's mission and has a high potential for customer impact.

Quantifiable Impact: A solution that addresses this problem could potentially reduce project delays by 20% within six months of implementation.

Defining problems effectively allows your product team to focus their efforts on creating solutions that directly address customer pain points. This approach increases the likelihood of building products that customers genuinely need and want, ultimately leading to greater customer satisfaction and business success.

## Option Exploration

"Option Exploration" is a critical step in the product development process, where you generate, evaluate, and analyze various solutions to the problems you've identified. This step is essential for fostering innovation, identifying the most viable solutions, and ensuring that you're addressing customer needs effectively. Here's more information on option exploration:

1. Divergent Thinking: Encourage your product team to think creatively and come up with a wide range of potential solutions. Avoid narrowing down options too early to allow for a diverse set of ideas.
2. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Involve team members from different disciplines (design, engineering, marketing, etc.) to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the option exploration process.
3. Idea Generation: Brainstorm and generate multiple ideas that have the potential to solve the identified problems. Encourage team members to think beyond conventional solutions.
4. Solution Hypotheses: Develop hypotheses for each potential solution. These hypotheses should outline how the solution addresses the problem, the expected impact on users, and any assumptions that need to be validated.
5. Prototyping: Create rough prototypes, wireframes, or mock-ups of the potential solutions. This can help visualize how the solutions might work and allow for early user feedback.
6. Feasibility Assessment: Evaluate the feasibility of each solution in terms of technical complexity, resources required, and alignment with the company's capabilities.
7. Market Fit: Assess how well each solution aligns with the needs and preferences of your target market. Consider whether the solution has the potential to create a competitive advantage.
8. Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks associated with each solution, such as market adoption challenges, technical hurdles, or changes in customer behavior.
9. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Evaluate the potential benefits and costs of each solution. This includes both tangible factors (financial gains) and intangible factors (brand reputation, customer loyalty).

Example:

Continuing with the "TechSolutions" project management tool example:

Problem: Remote teams struggle with coordinating tasks and staying aligned on project progress due to scattered communication channels and lack of real-time updates.

Potential Solutions Explored:

+ Real-Time Task Updates: Develop a feature that allows team members to update task progress in real-time, providing transparency and improving coordination.

Risk Assessment:

+ Solution 1: Moderate risk, as user adoption depends on ease of use and integration into existing workflows.
+ Solution 2: Moderate risk related to integration challenges and user adoption of a new communication hub.
+ Solution 3: High risk due to technical complexity and potential errors in time zone adjustments.

Cost-Benefit Analysis:

Solution 1: High potential benefit in terms of improved team efficiency and collaboration.
Solution 2: Positive impact on user experience and potential for increased engagement.
Solution 3: Limited benefit due to the specialized nature of the feature.

By exploring these potential solutions, you're laying the groundwork for informed decision-making and selecting the solution that best aligns with your product strategy, target market, and company capabilities. Keep in mind that not all solutions may proceed to development; some might be discarded in favor of those with higher potential for success and impact.

## Defining Outcomes

"Defining Outcomes" is a pivotal step in the product development process that involves setting clear and measurable objectives for the solutions you've chosen to pursue. These outcomes serve as benchmarks to measure the success and impact of your efforts. By defining outcomes, you ensure that your team remains focused, aligned, and accountable throughout the development cycle. Here's more information on defining outcomes:

1. Measurable Metrics: Choose metrics that are specific, quantifiable, and directly related to the problem you're addressing and the solution you're implementing.
2. Business Value: Define outcomes that align with your company's business goals and contribute to its growth and success.
3. Customer-Centricity: Focus on outcomes that indicate improved value and satisfaction for your customers. Customer success is a strong driver of business success.
4. Short-Term and Long-Term: Set both short-term and long-term outcomes. Short-term outcomes could involve immediate user engagement or adoption metrics, while long-term outcomes might focus on customer retention and revenue growth.
5. Baseline Measurement: Establish baseline measurements for the chosen metrics before implementing the solution. This provides a benchmark for assessing the solution's impact.
6. Realistic Expectations: Set achievable outcomes based on the solution's scope, potential challenges, and the resources allocated.
7. Alignment with Product Strategy: Ensure that the defined outcomes align with your product strategy and contribute to achieving the product's overall goals.

Example:

Continuing with the "TechSolutions" project management tool example:

Selected Solution: Real-Time Task Updates - Develop a feature that allows team members to update task progress in real-time, providing transparency and improving coordination.

Defined Outcomes:

+ Increase in Task Completion Speed: Reduce the average time it takes to complete a task by 20% within three months of launching the real-time task updates feature.
+ Enhanced Team Collaboration: Achieve a 15% increase in the number of tasks that involve collaboration among team members within six months.
+ Improved User Engagement: Increase daily active users (DAUs) by 25% within the first two months of implementing the feature.

Baseline Measurements:

+ Task Completion Speed: Currently, the average time to complete a task is 3 days.
+ Team Collaboration: Collaboration occurs in approximately 30% of tasks.
+ User Engagement: The current DAU count is 5,000.

Alignment with Product Strategy: These outcomes directly support the product strategy of improving remote team collaboration and providing real-time updates to address the identified problem.

By defining these outcomes, you provide your team with clear targets to work towards and establish a basis for evaluating the success of the solution. Monitoring progress against these outcomes allows you to make informed adjustments if needed and ensures that your efforts are driving meaningful impact for your customers and the business as a whole.

## Opportunity Canvas

An "Opportunity Canvas" is a visual framework used to capture and organize key information about a potential product or feature opportunity. It helps product teams align on the problem, solution, target audience, and success criteria before diving into the development process. The Opportunity Canvas serves as a tool for collaborative exploration and validation of ideas. Here's how it's typically structured:

Components of an Opportunity Canvas:

1. Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve. This should be concise and focused, outlining the pain points and challenges your target audience is facing.
2. Customer Jobs: List the specific tasks, needs, or goals that your target audience is trying to accomplish in relation to the problem.
3. Solution Ideas: Brainstorm potential solutions that could address the problem. These are high-level concepts or approaches that might lead to a solution.
4. Value Proposition: Describe the unique value your solution will provide to the target audience. How will it alleviate their pain points or help them achieve their goals?
5. Success Metrics: Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will indicate the success of your solution. These metrics should be specific, measurable, and aligned with your business goals.
6. Risks and Assumptions: Highlight any assumptions you're making about the problem, solution, or market. Also, identify potential risks or challenges that might impact the success of your solution.

Example Opportunity Canvas:

Let's imagine that "TechSolutions" is considering adding a new feature to their project management tool to enhance remote team collaboration:
